As already mentioned, there have been 3 independent earthquakes, as could be 
seen in Figure~\ref{fig:eq_start_heat}: Apr 6th 2:00~PM, Apr 8th 7:00~AM and Apr 
9th 3:00~PM, approximately. Those two last earthquakes are emphasized in
Figure~\ref{fig:eq_2_3_heat}.

By looking at the heatmap of Figure~\ref{fig:eq_cond_2_3_heat} for each
keyword, it can be seen that the damaged inflicted by the
second earthquake was greater than both first and second ones.

Suggestions for re-allocation of city resources are detailed as follows:   

\begin{itemize}                                                                  
     \item \emph{Medical:} At least 12 hours before 9:00 AM of April 8th, there was no ocurrances regarding
medical keywords. 
\begin{itemize} 
\item On April 8th from 9:00 PM to 10:59 PM, the second earthquake
time, there have been casualties on multiple locations
but we would prioritize the darker colored ones according to the heatmap of Figure 8a:
Northwest, Southton and Downtown. First, a rescue crew must be sent to Northwest
and Southton between     
     9:00~AM and 9:59~AM. Then, from 9:00~AM to 9:59~AM, for being geographically close a crew must be realocated to
Downtown. 

\item Again, between 12:00 PM and 13:00 PM there have been no medical ocurrances but from 13:00 PM
to 16:00 PM, the number of ocurrances increased significantly and affected
almost all neighbourhoods except Safetown and Terrapin Springs. Accordingly, we
would prioritize the dark-red-colored ones, Downtown and Palace Hills, sending
rescue team from 14:00~PM to 15:00~PM for both neighbourhoods.  

\item On following hours after that peak in ocurrances, there have been only sporadic
requests that could be solved by sending small units to individual locations.
 \end{itemize} 
\item \emph{Sewer and water:} A crew must be sent only to Weston between 4:00~PM and 4:59~PM.                                                          
     \smallskip                                                                   
     \item \emph{rain}: Issues have occurred in Pepper Mill, \textbf{Terrapin    
     Springs}, \textbf{Broadview}, Chapparal, \textbf{Southton}, \textbf{Old      
     Town} and Scenic Vista, but we'll consider only the locations                
     highlighted in bold because they have hospitals.                             
     \begin{itemize}                                                              
         \item A crew must be sent to Terrapin Springs between 3:00~PM and        
         3:59~PM. Broadview also has a power demand at this time interval but the 
         tweet frequency is much lower considering the five-hour period.                           \item Two crews must be sent to Old Town and Southton between 4:00~PM    
         and 4:59~PM.                                                             
         \item Lastly, the crew from Terrapin Springs can be reallocated to                Chapparal between 5:00~PM and 5:59~PM. Although Chapparal does not have  
         hospitals, it has been nearly two hours with electrical issues.          
     \end{itemize}                                                                
     \item \emph{R}: A crew must be sent to Southton only   
     because there have been small issues in Weston, Southton and Downtown, and   
     therefore Southton is geographically in the middle of such neighbourhoods.   
 \end{itemize}
