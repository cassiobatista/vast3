The earthquake has produced some already expected situations such as chaotic
traffic, despair among the population, etc., which has also generated some kind
of uncertainty at the data. For example, the keyword ``\emph{bridge}'' has been
mentioned multiple times, which suggests a structural problem that could've
ended in collapse if analysing the isolated word. However, by analysing the
whole context by means of a bar chart of retweets frequency, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:re_bridge_vbar}, we can see that most mentions refer to closing
bridges instead of reporting physical problems at the bridge.

Another point is with respect to fake news. At 8:00~AM of Apr 8th, the tweet
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:re_tsunami_fake}
appeared to warn users about an eventual tsunami, and a lot of retweets have
followed to spread such ``news''. Nevertheless, as reported on Apr 9th at
9:00~AM in the tweet shown in Figure~\ref{fig:re_tsunami_truth}, the city's
unique geography prevents such disaster to happen, and according to the greater
number of retweets we can infer this is the real truth about existence of
upcoming tsunamis in St. Himark.

A third discovery made through the retweets frequency bar chart is that there
was a circus show going on in town at the same week. So after the disaster
that endend with buildings falling down on the floor, the elephants from the
circus started to be used to help lifting heavy blocks of rocks in an attempt to
search for people or corpses. This information can be seen at
Figure~\ref{fig:re_circus}.
