<Location with-held due to contract>,FastCandyJerry,"KRAK TV: Wilderness Scout leaders admitted they might have made a mistake in putting out a call for donations. 'The community really stepped up and gave, and now we dont know what do with everything we have been given.' Scouts are piling through mountains of shoes, baby bottles, homecooked food, tire chains, and much, much more which have filled the warehouse donated by Vizsla brand stores. Local emergency managers recommend donating money to your favorite charity instead of goods. 'Experience from other disasters has shown that many donated items never get into the hands of people who need it. It creates a logistical nightmare and requires us to arseign precious resources to managing donations. Above all else, dont donate homecooked food - we just throw it away. ",11,disaster,2020-04-09 19:00:00,54
